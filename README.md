# What do you expect? Revisiting Expectation Formation Models

__Description:__ This project is the coding and data for my senior thesis focusing on evaluating and replicating expectation formation models.
Specifically, I replicate a sticky-information model, a noisy-information model, and a diagnostic expectations model.
